## Reporting an Issue

To report an issue, or to suggest an idea for a change that you haven't had time
to write-up yet, open an [issue](https://github.com/delhivery/project-polaris/issues). It
is best to check our existing
[issues](https://github.com/delhivery/project-polaris/issues) first to see if a similar
one has already been opened and discussed.

## Suggesting a Change

To suggest a change to this repository, submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/delhivery/project-polaris/issues)(PR) with the complete
set of changes you'd like to see. 

### Assigning and Owning work

If you want to own and work on an issue, add a comment or “#dibs” it asking
about ownership. A maintainer will then add the Assigned label and modify the
first comment in the issue to include `Assigned to: @person`
